- communication BE <-> FE should be done via REST API and websocket 2 ways and realtime
- FE is React with Vite as bundler and live reload on dev mode
- BE is py with live reload on dev mode Gunicorn as server
- DB is Postgres packed in a docker container
- They run all in a docker-compose setup
- BE handle data as ORM with SQLAlchemy
- BE expose REST API with FastAPI
- BE expose websocket with FastAPI
- BE handle authentication with JWT tokens
- FE handle state management with Redux Toolkit
- Postgres has the role for storing persistent data, but the cache layer is handled in app memory with Python dicts and lists for simplicity
- All configuration is handled with environment variables loaded from a .env file in docker-compose
- Logging is done with Python logging module on BE and with console.log on FE
- Error handling is done with FastAPI exception handlers on BE and with React error boundaries on FE
- Testing is done with Pytest on BE and with Jest on FE
- Health checks are exposed on BE with a dedicated /health endpoint
- CORS is handled on BE with FastAPI middleware to allow FE to communicate with it
- Ports should be not conflicting, e.g., BE on 8000, FE on 3000, Postgres on 5432
- Dockerfiles for BE and FE should be optimized for production with multi-stage builds
- Documentation should be generated with Sphinx for BE and with Storybook for FE
- Coding practices follows PEP 8 for Python and Airbnb style guide for JavaScript. Use best practices for security, performance, and scalability.
- The FE has both desktop and mobile responsive designs using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- We have 3 main components of the system: Presentation Website, Application (FE + BE + Database) and Admin Dashboard
